Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win The download should start on its own. This isn't actually Git, its called Git for Windows. You can find out more GFW at gitforwindows.org. 

To clone the repository for OWLS, direct yourself to where you want the repo folder to go on your command prompt and then type "git clone https://github.com/RobKlock/151owls ". The repository folder should appear.
